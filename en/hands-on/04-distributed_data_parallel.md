## Summary of the tutorial

> * [DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel) (DDP) implements data parallelism at the module level which can run across multiple machines. 
> * Applications using DDP should spawn multiple processes and create a single DDP instance per process.
> * DDP uses collective communications in the [torch.distributed](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html) package to synchronize gradients and buffers.
>   * DDP registers an autograd hook for each parameter given by `model.parameters()`.
>   * The hook will fire when the corresponding gradient is computed in the backward pass.
>   * DDP uses that signal to trigger gradient synchronization across processes.
>
> * The recommended way to use DDP
>   * is to spawn one process for each model replica
>     * where a model replica can span multiple devices
> * DDP processes can be placed on the same machine or across machines.
> * GPU devices cannot be shared across processes.

## Some important details about DDP

Skewed Processing Speeds

> * In DDP, distributed synchronization points are
>   * the constructor,
>   * the forward pass, and
>   * the backward pass. 
> * Different processes are expected to 
>   * launch the same number of synchronizations and 
>   * reach these synchronization points in the same order and 
>   * enter each synchronization point at roughly the same time. 
> * Otherwise, fast processes might arrive early and timeout on waiting for stragglers. 
>   * Hence, users are responsible for balancing workloads distributions across processes.
>
> * Sometimes, skewed processing speeds are inevitable due to, e.g., 
>   * network delays,
>   * resource contentions,
>   * unpredictable workload spikes.
> * To avoid timeouts in these situations, make sure that you pass a sufficiently large `timeout` value when calling [init_process_group](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#torch.distributed.init_process_group).

Save and Load Checkpoints

> * It’s common to use `torch.save` and `torch.load` to checkpoint modules during training and recover from checkpoints. 
> * When using DDP, one optimization is 
>   * to save the model in only one process and then load it to all processes, 
>     * reducing write overhead.
>   * This is correct because all processes start from the same parameters and gradients are synchronized in backward passes, and hence optimizers should keep setting parameters to the same values. 
> * If you use this optimization, make sure all processes do not start loading before the saving is finished. 
>   * Besides, when loading the module, you need to provide an appropriate `map_location` argument to prevent a process to step into others’ devices. 
>     * If `map_location` is missing, `torch.load` will first load the module to CPU and then copy each parameter to where it was saved, 
>       * which would result in all processes on the same machine using the same set of devices.
> * For more advanced failure recovery and elasticity support, please refer to [TorchElastic](https://pytorch.org/elastic).

## Run the code on Amazon EC2

```bash
$ mkdir 04-distributed_data_parallelism
$ cd 04-distributed_data_parallelism
```

### Basic Use Case

> DDP wraps lower-level distributed communication details and provides a clean API as if it is a local model. Gradient synchronization communications take place during the backward pass and overlap with the backward computation. When the `backward()` returns, `param.grad` already contains the synchronized gradient tensor. For basic use cases, DDP only requires a few moSave and Load Checkpointsre LoCs to set up the process group. When applying DDP to more advanced use cases, some caveaCombine DDP with Model Parallelismts require caution.

Copy and paste the source code

```bash
$ nano pytorch_tutorials-distributed_data_parallelism-basic_use_case.py
```

Run it on a machine or machines with 8 GPUs.

```bash
$ python pytorch_tutorials-distributed_data_parallelism-basic_use_case.py
$
```

Otherwise, the following error occurs.

```bash
$ python pytorch_tutorials-distributed_data_parallelism-basic_use_case.py 
Requires at least 8 GPUs to run, but got 4.
